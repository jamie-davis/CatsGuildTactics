Three phases

Phase 1 - split the raid evenly (odd and even groups). Boss casts Scatterblast Canisters which half the raid
must soak. You cannot survive two in a row, so tank swap and the next group takes the next cast.

Big Bad Buncha Bombs scatters high damage bombs that leave a large DOT, avoid the circles.

Random players get Sappers Satchel. After 7 seconds does an AOE.

Tank needs to stay in melee range or else Gatling Cannon does high damage.

Phase 2 starts at 100 energy. Darkfuse Technicians will spawn and activate Giga Coils which AOE the raid (south east coil first). These mobs drop a Giga Bomb which can be picked up and using the extra action button can destroy the Giga Controls for the active coil.

Special Projects: someone must disable the coil with a Giga Bomb. Extra bombs must be thrown into the hole
in the middle of the arena.

Giga Bombs explode after 55 seconds or if hit by Giga Blast.

Giga Blast is an obvious blue line targeting a ranged player. Ranged can bait this away from Giga Bombs. Avoid the line.

Random players will be marked with Fused Canisters. One other player must join them to soak a stacking heal absorb. If nobody helps, the raid takes the heal absorb.

All P1 mechanics continue until 50% health.

Intermission: Cratering. Boss leaps up and kills anyone in landing zone, then puts up a shield and casts TOTAL DESTRUCTION!!! - break the shield and interrupt.

Phase 3 - Bigger Badder Bomb Blast on tank. Swap and take the massive circle to edge and away, everyone else leave the circle.

Big Bad Buncha Bombs from P1/P2 still available.

A few players will be marked witb a directional arrow which shows where Overloaded Rockets will go. Don't move too much so other players can avoid.

Three Tick-Tock Canisters spawn on floor and explode after 8 seconds. At least two players
must soak split damage and healing absorb. Healing absorb must be healed off within 30 seconds or players take damage. If a canister is not soaked the healing absorb goes on the whole raid and can wipe us.

Giga Coils continue. If a coil is disabled twice it will be destroyed and a quarter of the floor is electrified. Finish the fight before there is no space left.

Gallibux Final Blast AOE does damage that drops with range so run away.

Tank buster: Ego Check does 4 physical hits. Total unmitigated damage from all 4 hits is applied as a DOT so use defensive.
