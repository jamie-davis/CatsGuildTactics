Three phases

Phase 1 - split the raid evenly (odd and even groups). Boss casts Scatterblast Canisters which half the raid
must soak. You cannot survive two in a row, so tank swap and the next group takes the next cast.

Big Bad Buncha Bombs scatters high damage bombs that leave a large DOT, avoid the circles.

Random players get Sappers Satchel. After 7 seconds does an AOE.

Tank needs to stay in melee range or else Gatling Cannon does high damage.

Phase 2 starts at 100 energy. Darkfuse Technicians will spawn and activate Giga Coils which AOE the raid (south east coil first). These mobs drop a Giga Bomb which can be picked up and using the extra action button can destroy the Giga Controls for the active coil.

Special Projects: someone must disable the coil with a Giga Bomb. Extra bombs must be thrown into the hole
in the middle of the arena.

Giga Bombs explode after 55 seconds or if hit by Giga Blast.

Giga Blast is an obvious blue line targeting a ranged player. Ranged can bait this away from Giga Bombs. Avoid the line.

Random players will be marked with Fused Canisters. One other player must join them to soak a stacking heal absorb. If nobody helps, the raid takes the heal absorb.

All P1 mechanics continue until 50% health.
