Phase 1:

Arena has 4 sections, and the boss will electrify two of them at a time with Wire Transfer. Random players will get Screw Up, move away because you will drop drills that stun players and apply a DOT. 

Boss places inventions on conveyer belts. He will cast Activate Inventions which will cause an effect depending on the invention he has out. Blazing Beams will create lines on the floor; don't stand in them. Rocket Barrage will shoot rockets; dodge them. Mega Magnetize will pull you towards magnets which stun you; resist the pull.

Tanks will get a stacking Gravi-Gunk debuff increasing damage taken, and periodically will get Pyro Party Pack which they will need to take away as it explodes, dealing AOE damage that reduces with distance - i.e. it's better if it's far away.

Tank swap on 5 stacks of Gravi-Gunk or on Pyro Party Pack.

Phase 2:

Starts with a knockback, and electrifies all sections except the conveyor belts. This phase has a constant AOE and healing absorb on the raid. Move to the boss, dodge the swirlies. Boss gets a damage upgrade at the end of each Phase 2.
