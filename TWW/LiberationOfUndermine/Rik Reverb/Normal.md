Phase 1: Boss drops amplifiers. Amplifiers do raid damage which increases by 25% for each additional amplifier. Amplifiers gain energy gradually. At 100% they wipe the raid but you can drain the energy by clicking on it and channeling. Chanelling does ticking damage.

If the boss is within 15 yards the amplifiers gain energy faster so tank the boss away from them. However, the amps should not be too far apart for the Blaring Drop phase.

The boss auto attacks cleave and apply a stacking Tinnitus debuff. Turn him away and tank swap on 5 stacks.

Phase 2: Blaring Drop. Boss sends out a giant circle which will kill anyone it hits. The only way to survive it is to find the  amplifier with a blue circle and get into the circle. This repeats for each amplifier. Amplifiers that are far apart can make this difficult, so don't spread them too far.
