Phase 1: 

The boss summons 3 Wheel Attendants during Spin To Win; kill them and they will drop tokens - Fire, Coin, Shock or Bomb.

Special projects: Two of the tokens need to be picked up by walking over them, and deposited in the boss with the extra action button. Each time this happens a different combination needs to be activated. If we don't deposit two tokens in 30 seconds, or we repeat a combination, the boss gets a 500% damage buff.

Flame and Coin = heavy raid damage

Flame and Bomb = 3 large adds fixate players

Coin and Shock = magnetic pylon

Coin and Bomb = 5 small adds fixate players

Shock and Flame = pylon that shoots fire.

Pylons will remain after activating, and will reactivate during every Spin To Win.

While Reel Attendants are active, random players get a dispellable Withering Flames which reduces maximum health each tick. When dispelled you create fire waves. Move out to get dispelled.

On Pay-Line, two coins will be sent out from the boss. Blue lines mark their path. Players are stunned if hit, but get a damage buff on a near miss. Coins do an AOE when they hit a wall and fall over. Resting coins must be sent back to the boss by walking over them and using the extra action button. Any coin not sent back buffs boss damage.

Peridically, boss releases Foul Exhaust, a large AOE and healing absorb hitting all players.

Tanks: Swap on The Big Hit, when it lands the tank will leave a Shocking Field. Targeted tank should spawn the field at the edge. Tanks can use pylons to clear fields.

Phase 2: Cheat To Win

Startes at 30% health - 1min 40s hard enrage. No more coins, but boss links beams to pylons. Hot Hot Heat targets two players with beams, they get a red mark and should move out.
