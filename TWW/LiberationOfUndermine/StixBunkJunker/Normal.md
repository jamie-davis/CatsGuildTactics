There are small and large garbage piles all over. The boss will put Rolling Rubbish on the tank and up to 4 random players - if it's you there will be a yellow arrow above you. Be ready when this happens and once you have a ball run over 4 small piles and then 4 large piles to get a full sized ball. With a full ball the priority is to run it into Discarded Doomsplosives (big bombs). If you don't and they detonate it's a wipe. If there are no bombs left you can run the ball into the boss to deal big damage. Running over pedestrians stuns them so don't. Running into another ball bounces both of you, so don't do that either.

Tank swap on Demolish (the active tank will ride a ball).

You will get Incinerator, an orange circle, which can set fire to garbage. Burning a pile adds a Toxic Fumes debuf to the raid, and leaves a permanent burning pile of Hot Garbage.

During Overdrive the boss willfly, take almost no damage, and create lightning zones you must avoid. On landing Discarded Doomsplosives will spawn and the garbage ball cycle resumes.

Junkyard Hyenas and Scrapmaster adds will spawn. Hyenas bite people, Scrapmasters fire Scap Rockets.
