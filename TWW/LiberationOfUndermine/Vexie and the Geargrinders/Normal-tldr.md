Phase 1 - Tank boss near wall, swap on Tank Buster. DPS kill bikers and use their bikes to ram the boss. Phase 2 - Boss takes double damage. Use Bloodlust, CC/Interrupt/Kill Pit Mechanics. Heal through raid damage.
If you get a big purple circle you are going to Spew Oil, so take it out of the way.
