The fight has two phases:

Phase 1 - Fury Road
The boss has 6 stacks of Protective Plating which must be removed. When all stacks are gone, phase 2 will start. Boss will use Tank Buster which gives the tank a debuff making the next Tank Buster do 200% damage. Tank swap on each Tank Buster.
Special Projects: Bikers will spawn which will give up their bikes on death. Players must kill the bikers and fire the bikes into the boss to remove plates.

Phase 2 - Pit Stop
The boss breaks down and requires repairs from Pit Mechanics. While the repairs are unfinished (max 45 seconds), she takes 100% extra damage. During this phase, the boss does raid wide Backfire damage, and also Burning Shrapnel to any player within 3 yards.
Special Projects: Pit mechanics repair 5% of the plating every 2 seconds. Once it is fully repaired Phase 1 restarts. Pit mechanics can be CC'd. There is a Support Rig which makes them immune to CC if they are within 15 yards, so CC is only effective outside that zone. Allowing them to channel will reduce the length of the phase.

Phase 1 best practice is to group up close to the boss to bait the bikers and AOE them down.
Phase 2 best practice is to interrupt, CC and kill the Pit Mechanics to extend phase 2.
