The bosses must be kept apart, so the raid must split into two groups. Odd number groups take Flerendo, even numbers take Torq. The bosses apply a stacking debuf, so the two groups must swap bosses after each intermisson.
During intermission the bosses will go to the centre and do raid wide damage for 20 seconds. Avoid circles and blobs.

Flerendo: The boss will place a giant bomb which must be soaked to split the damage when it explodes. A player will be targeted with a beam attack. The beam will follow you until it goes off, but there is time to step out of once it stops tracking you so there is no need to take any damage. Point the beam at a wall and avoid the bomb soakers.

Tank buster: Eruption Stomp. Throws the tank into the air leaving a molten pool and creating fiery waves.

Torq: Players get static charge from moving so minimise movement. Watch your charge meter. If it fills you will be stunned for 6 seconds. Thunderdrum Salvo creates circles you need tom avoid - be careful not to move excessively. 

Tank buster: Lightning Bash. Heavy physical damage plus nature dot.
