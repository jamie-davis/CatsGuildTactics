Arena has two sides. Red (right) and blue (left). Each side has different mechanics, and the active side depends on where the majority of the raid are standing. There are also two phases - phase 1 has the mechanics of the current side only but phase 2 has all of the mechanics. During Phase 1, if the boss reaches 100 energy the raid will wipe. Swapping sides resets the energy bar but applies a debuff to the raid. We generally do a blue side only tactic, where we activate the red side briefly to reset the energy, but immediately go back to blue.

Red:

Earthshaker Gaol - two players will be marked, damage must be soaked by 5 players including one healer. The soak group will be locked in a gaol with an add. Kill the add to escape, interrupt Pay Respects. Do not overlap the gaols and do not have the boss inside.

Frostshatter Boots - movement effect on random non-gaol players. Makes it hard to start or stop moving.

Stormfury Finger Gun - locks on a random player and does a cone attack. Stop moving when targeted so other players can avoid the cone.

Tank gets Molten Gold Knuckles. Swap tanks. Targeted tank gets knocked back, debuffed and leaves molten gold trail. Drop the gold around the edge.

Blue:

MkII Electro Shocker. Summons two adds that do raid damage at the start of the blue phase. At 80% they get a 12 second stun and take double damage.

Unstable Crawler Mines. Immune to damage, ypu have to walk into them to blow them up. only do this if you are healthy.

Goblin Guided Rocket. Rockets must be soaked by at leadt half the raid, at the edge of the room. An add will be summoned.

Spray And Pray. Cone attach on random player. Stop moving so everyone else can avoid.

Double Whammy. Targets a random player and puts a line on the floor. Tank must stand in the way, reducing the damage the player takes. Stop moving so that the tank can get into position.


Intermission: Bullet Storm. At 40%, charges at a random player. Once he stops he does a cone attack from each hand and rotates. Avoid the cones by staying in front or behind as he turns. Repeats 3 times.

Phase 2: The Head Honcho. The boss has all abilities, plus a 30% haste buff. At 100 energy he wipes the raid.
