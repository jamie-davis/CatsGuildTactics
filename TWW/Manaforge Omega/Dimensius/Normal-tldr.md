Split the raid. Odd numbered groups will go left, even numbered groups will go right - 4 ranged in each group are Gravity players 
and must pick up Excess Mass from dead Living Mass adds. Gravity players pull down floaters. Missing Excess Mass will wipe the raid.

Phase 1: Using portals pulls the boss. Kill the adds in the centre and collect mass. Everyone group for first Devour and then split
left and right. For subsequent Devours stack your group.

Leave active Tank in the centre, swap on Massive Smash. Outgoing tank rejoins their group.

Living Mass will spawn on each side. Kill and take Excess Mass to survive next Devour. Players who get Reverse Gravity take it to the 
edge, Gravity players pull floaters down to save them.

Phase 2: Take flight before Soaring Reshii debuf fades, or die. Fly through rings and land on platform to kill miniboss. Kill adds
to create gaps for side-to-side and front-to-back movement. Watch Dimensius hands - move to extreme edge away from his hand if he
raises it. After metor, move to front (near boss) to take push back (don't get pushed off).

Tanks swap before getting 10 Touch of Oblivion stacks, otherwise it means death. Flight/fight repeats for second miniboss.

Phase 3:

Dimensius takes 50% bonus damage for 15 seconds. Boss will summon oribiting Voidstars that give shelter from Devour, but he will
gradually turn them into black holes.

Meteors will land in circles on the ground. Impact sends Shadowquake ring which applies 3 second debuf - watch order of circles
and make sure your debuf drops before taking the next ring. Tanks may need to take two stacks - if so, use a defensive. Tanks will
get Cosmic Collapse which does large damage in 12 yeard radius, players avoid.
