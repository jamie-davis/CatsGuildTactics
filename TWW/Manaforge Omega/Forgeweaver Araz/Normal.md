Phase 1:

Tank swap on Arcane Obliteration. Players MUST soak the damage. Effect applies split damage, a large healing absorb, Astral 
Mark and spawns an Arcane Echo at the location.

Boss will also stack the Overwhelming Power DOT on the active tank, in phase 1 Arcane Obliteration
will cause swaps at an appropriate interval. Outside of phase 1 the DOT needs to be monitored and swap 
on 2 to 3 stacks.

Pylons will spawn from Invoke Collector and create lots of orbs that need to be dodged. Pylons are independent.

Pylons periodically cast Astral Harvest which will do damage for 4 seconds before spawning an add at the players location. 
Try to spawn the add at the boss. The adds can be CC'd. Each pylon will target 3 players each time it casts this mechanic.

Intermission: x2, first at around 2 mins 30.

Shielded Attendants will spawn in the centre of the room. Tanks pick up one each. They deal increasing 
damage, so swap adds during Mana Splinter.

Pylons will fire Photon Blasts at random players, avoid them. At full energy, the Pylons will 
use Arcane Convergence and do heavy raid damage. Aim to destroy the pylons before this. Target the pylon with 
the circle first.

When the pylons are down (or at timed intervals), Mana Splinter will stun the boss and he takes extra damage. 
There will be 2 Mana Splinters in the fight.

Phase 2 starts after 2 intermissions, or the boss is at 15%:

The Dark Singularity will appear in the forge and you will be knocked away from the boss. Try to get knocked toward the entrance.
The pull of the singularity will draw you towards it and you will die if you touch it. The pull
increases over time.

Void Harvest will do damage for 4 seconds before spawning an add at the players location. 
Try to spawn the add at the boss. The adds can be CC'd. Do not allow the adds to reach the 
Dark Singularity as they will do heavy raid wide damage.
