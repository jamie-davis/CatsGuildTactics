Phase 1:

All players begin with 3 stacks of Decree: Oath-Bound. If you don't remove all of the stacks by the
end of the phase you will be mind controlled. (But not if the boss hits 50% before that.)

Conquer will be cast on the Tank and must be soaked by the group. This will remove a stack of 
Oath-Bound from every player in the soak. Every player in the soak will be knocked into the air. 
You can only soak one Conquer every 20 seconds. Remember to soak 3 before the end of the phase.

Vanquish will be cast on the tank and will cleave every player in front of the boss. The tank can
take one Vanquish every 20 seconds.

Tanks should swap quickly on every cast of Conquer or Vanquish. The boss cannot just alternate 
between the two abilities, so taunting on every cast will ensure that each tank will take a 
different hit each time (i.e. it will be in sets of CVVC, CCVV, VVCC, or VCCV). Swap promptly.

Players targeted with Behead should move away.

Phase 2 comes after 3 sets or at 50%, when the boss mounts the dragon:

Prioritise hitting the Dragon during this phase. The phase will begin with a knock back - do not
get knocked off the edge. 

Tank will be hit with Dimension Breath which must be faced away from the raid. Additional portals
will open and also emit the breath - these portals are placed by players hit with Netherbreaker. 
Netherbreaker players should all run to the same edge of the platform to make the Dimension Breath
from the portals easier to avoid.

Behead will still be cast.

Intermission 1 - 45 seconds into Phase 2:

Odd numbered groups go to left platform, even go to right platform. Go to a platform using the
Extra Action button. Kill the adds on the platform and use the button to return. Phase 2 will 
resume.

The adds on each platform will be one Manaforged Titan, one Nexus Prince and several Shadowguard
Reapers. Kill the Titan before it self destructs. Interrupt the Nexus Prince's Netherblast.
Cleave down the Reapers.

Intermission 2 - at the end of Phase 2:

Boss dismounts and channels King's Hunger. He will have a 99% damage reduction, but the Dragon 
will take 100% more damage. At the end of the channel, any dragon health remaining will be
transferred to the boss. During the channel, the raid takes damage.

Behead will still be cast.

Phase 3:

Boss will hit the tank and up to 5 others with Galactic Smash. Players targeted will spawn a 
Dark Star rift which will pull people in at first and then create rings of spikes outwards.

The boss will target up to two players and the tank with Starkiller Swing. Targeted players need
to run to stand behind a Dark Star which will absorb a missile and be destroyed. If you are not
behind a Dark Star everyone will be hit.

Tank swap on Galactic Smash and Starkiller swing.

The sequence is Smash/Swing/Swing. The fourth sequence is an enrage.
