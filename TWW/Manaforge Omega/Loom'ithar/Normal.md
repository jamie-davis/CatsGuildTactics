Phase 1:
Infusion Tether will target several non-tank players. If targeted, snap the tether by running to outer ring, when a pool of Living Silk will spawn. Thie deals a large amount of damage, so place them out of the raid and close together to conserve space. Space will be needed in phase 2.

Piercing Strand - tank swap. Tank will get a 45 second debuf causing 1000% damage. It is possible for both tanks to be hit so avoid that.

Lair Weaving - a ring of adds will spawn around the edge of the room. They will slowly converge on the boss. Kill one to make an escape route.

At 100 energy boss casts Overfusion Burst. Run to the edge, avoiding Living Silk pools.

Phase 2 (at 50% HP): Boss casts Unbound Rage and descends, and takes increased damage. Bloodlust in this phase.
Centre of the room will be covered with Archane Ichor, so everyone needs to play on the edges of the room, avoiding Living Silk pools.

Writhing Wave frontal on the active tank must be split with 5+ other players to avoid the boss getting Writhing Swathe absorbe shield.

Arcane Outrage does heavy damage to the raid and spawns more Archane Ichor, forcing everyone to move.
