Phase 1:

Healers/DPS randomly targeted with Manifest Matrices. This spanws a permanent damage pool beneath you. Take it aside and don't trap others. Pools do high damage and randomly teleport players, avoid them.

Tanks: Swap on Obliteration Arcocannon. Targeted tank needs to run away from raid - detonation will damage the raid based on the distance.

Raid stack behind boss. Eradicating Salvo must be split soaked.

At 100 energy, the boss teleports to the next room with a push back.

Phase 2:

Avoid Energy Cutters (high damage) and Expulsion Zone (damage and knock back).
The Phase Blink (extra action button) will allow you to pass the moving Arcanomatrix Atomizer walls.
