Single phase with intermissions:

There are three bosses that all need to die at similar times as they cast a rapidly escalating pulse AOE on death.
Adarus cannot be tanked and will move around the room. Keep the other bosses stacked on Adarus.

On pull, Velaryn will cast Fel Inferno which applies a stacking DOT to the raid. Healers should be 
ready with a cooldown.

Two Devourer's Ire zones will spawn on the floor and should be picked up by ranged. 
The players with Devourer's Ire can soak Encroaching Oblivion pools spawned when Adarus teleports.

Devourer's Ire can be dispelled and it will jump to the nearest available player.

Blade Dance lines will appear and deal high damage, avoid them.

Velaryn casts The Hunt and an echo will charge a non-tank dealing fatal damage which is reduced by each player 
standing in the path of the charge. The damage can be soaked by other players. If you are targeted,
make the line as long as possible to allow more players to get into it and ideally take it to a 
clump of players, such as the melee group.

Tanks have two mechanics to deal with. Swap after BOTH mechanics have finished.

Ilyssa casts Fracture creates Shattered Souls of the tank reducing the healing taken and giving a debuff causing 
them to take increased damage from the next Fracture. The souls must be killed before Spirit Bomb, which will 
follow shortly.

Velaryn casts Eye Beam which pushes the tank slowly backwards and must be faced away from the raid. 
Each tick increases the damage done. At the end of the channel, Felblade will be cast on the tank 
doing high fire damage and a 25 second dot.

Healers need to be alert on the pull. Spirit Bomb, which follows Fracture deals raid wide damage and 
applies a healing absorb.
Ilyssa has an Immolation Aura which damages the raid every two seconds.

1. Adarus Intermission:

Everyone spread out. Boss hit box is very large.

An Event Horizon will be created in the centre, which pulls players toward it and does high damage if touched.

Collapsing Stars will spawn at the edge of the room and will be pulled into the Event Horizon. 
These must be soaked and do heavy raid damage if they reach the centre.


2. Velaryn Intermission:

Everyone spread out. Boss hit box is very large. This mechanic repeats.

Echoes will be summoned that Fel Rush random players, which will be marked with a line. 
Don't stand in someone else's line - try to avoid by walking along your line to reduce confusion.

3. Ilyssa Intermission:

Everyone stack. These mechanics repeat.

Ilyssa will use Infernal Strike to jump to the edge which damage and knock back anyone 
within 18 yards. A random player will be targeted with Fel Devastation which is a wide cone of
damage to anyone in the path. Everyone should move behind the boss.
