There are 6 lanes in an arc in front of the boss. During the fight there are wall mechanics which
involve placing walls in the lanes. If a lane gets 6 walls, the boss will wipe the raid, so never 
allow more than 5. Designate lane 3, counting while FACING the boss as safe, and never put a wall
there.

Walls are placed by two players targeted with Crystalline Shockwave. If you are targeted, choose a 
lane with less than 5 walls, and never the safe lane (an arrow from the boss will indicate the 
lane). After you place the wall, you will get a DOT and require healing. The DOT stacks so do not
place multiple walls in the same lane at the same time.

Tanks will also get Crystalline Shockwave after they are hit with Shockwave Slam. Swap on the slam
and place the wall.

Walls are also removed with a similar mechanic when players are targeted with Shattershell. You will
take shadow damage for 6 seconds. Move to a lane with walls that need removing. You will be rooted
for 4 seconds. Do not Shattershell multiple times in the same lane, only one wall will be 
removed.

When walls are shattered, a shrapnell zone will be created and must be avoided.
