Lane 3, counting while FACING the boss, is safe - never put a wall there. If you get Crystalline 
Shockwave place your wall in a lane with less than 5 walls. Tank swap on Shockwave Slam, tank will
get Crystalline Shockwave and must place a wall. Players with Shattershell remove walls. Do not
stack Shattershell in the same lane - only one wall will be removed.

Wall placing applies a DOT to anyone in the lane. Move out of the lane if someone is placing a 
wall. Lane 3 should always be safe.
