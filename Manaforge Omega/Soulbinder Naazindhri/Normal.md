2 minute cycles, starting with Soul Calling which pulls up 6 chambers containing adds throughout the room.
Adds cast Soulweave and will spawn when it finishes. Soulfray Annihilation beams can be used to destroy 
one chamber each. Beams spawn 2 at a time on random players and there will be 6 in total.

Tank the boss near the chambers. Targeted players need to aim their beam at a chamber by standing behind it. 
The beam will release the add and the it can be killed. Work through the 6 chambers.

Soulfire Convergence - targeted players will get four lines radiating from them. When the mechanic 
fires, orbs will launch outwards following the lines. If targeted, move out of the raid and make sure your 
orbs will not hit other players when they fire.

Arcane Explosion - Raid wide knockback. Don't fall off the edge. Applies a raid wide DOT.

Mystic Lash - tank swap. Use cooldowns.

Spellburn - constant raid wide damage.

Adds:

Shadowguard Mage (grip if far away) casts Void Burst which applies a dot. Interrupt the cast.

Shadowguard Assassin jumps to a player and casts Voidblade Ambush which does AOE damage. Ranged and healers spread out, but not too far away so that AOE damage can hit the Assassins.

Shadowguard Phaseblade does a small amount of raid wide damage.
