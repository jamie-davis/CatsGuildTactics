Split the raid. Odd numbered groups will go left, even numbered groups will go right (but not at the beginning). Assign 4 
players in each group to pick up Excess Mass. Yes 4 - ideally ranged. These are the gravity players and will have three jobs:

1. Collect Excess Mass from downed Living Mass adds by walking over it.
2. Stand under floating players to pull them down before Dimensius kills them.
3. Create safe zones for your group to stand in during Devour.

Before starting the fight there are two portals. Take the one on the same side as your group and be ready to kill the Living Mass
as you land.

Phase 1:

The boss is pulled by using portals to reach his platform. I.e. the first player up there pulls the boss. Don't go too soon.

Two Living Mass adds will be on the platform at the start of the fight. More will spawn from the Boss's Massive Smash Ability. 
The adds drop Excess Mass, which should be picked up by assigned players. At the start, everyone can stay in the central section.
At 100 energy the boss will cast Devour and everyone should stack. Raid damage will tick for 5 seconds after which anyone not
in a Voidstar's Gravity Well will basically get eaten. After this first Devour the groups should split left and right.
The boss will cast again each time he reaches 100 energy and players should stack in their groups for subsequent Devours.

Tanks: Fists Of the Voidlord deals damage to the active tank and anyone within 15 yards. Any players hit will be knocked back. 
The tank should be in the centre and clear of the raid to avoid this. Tank swap on Massive Smash, which will knock back the entire 
raid. The outgoing tank should join their group.

Massive Smash spawns a Living Mass which needs to be killed. The dropped Excess Mass should be collected by a gravity player.

Players will be randomly targeted with Reverse Gravity which will cause you to float upwards. Before you leave the ground head to
the back so that a gravity player can pull you down. If you don't get pulled down you die.

Periodically Shattered Space will create damage zones and spawn Living Mass adds. Kill them and the Gravity players will need to 
pick up new Excess Mass debuffs ready for the next Devour.

Phase 2:

When phase 2 starts you will get a Soaring Reshii debuf and must mount up. If you are too slow you will die. Fly through
rings to the first platform. On the way avoid the rocks and try to get a Stellar Core if you can which will do 5% damage to the 
miniboss on the platform.

On the platform is a miniboss that must be killed to progress. Shortly after landing adds will spawn in a cross formation and you
will not be able to pass through them. To make gaps to pass through, kill one add in each wall. Mechanics require the raid to
move from side to side and backwards and forwards, so gaps must be created to allow this.

Dimensius will cast Extinction on one side of the platform. You can see which side by watching which hand he raises. Move to the 
opposite edge of the platform to avoid a meteor. After this move to the side of the platform closest to Dimensius because he will
push the raid backwards and you need to avoid getting pushed off the edge. 

Once the miniboss is dead, there is another skyride and another miniboss. The minibosses themselves have different mechanics that 
must be avoided - the first does a frontal called Mass Ejection, the summons a Stardust Nova which damages players within 10 yards.

Both minibosses apply stacks of Rouch of Oblivion. Tanks must swap before getting 10 stacks (or 15 according to some guides), 
otherwise it means death.

Phase 3:
